<p>2c This is a library guide written for LIS 704, Reference and Online Services, taught by Jeanne Holba Puacz. Since communities are diverse and their learning can be on many different levels, library guides are a good resource to provide content in a variety of formats. The goal to assess information needs means that the librarian has to provide a resource that can fit all people. While library guides can serve as a base, the librarian still needs to make a connection with the user before they can recommend any particular format. On this library guide, there are different formats of resources, mostly websites and books, that approach descriptions of movies in different ways such as genre, actors, subject, release date, or family-friendly content. Although it may not be inclusive of everything and might need to be updated frequently with newer publications as more movies are published, it does address a variety of search methods suited for multiple user types.</p>

<p>2d This is a finding aid written for LIS 775 taught by Cecilia Salvatore. This Introduction to Archival Principles, Practices, and Services covered the information needs of archival data and users. Part of information needs is to know the content and another part is to know the audience and formulate a response to those needs. In Intro to Archives, we were given boxes of a collection and told to organize it. Knowing that we cannot change the original order it was given to us in archives, my group worked on a finding aid that represented the organization as a whole as well as some of the specific contents included in the collection. We addressed those who might look at this collection because they were part of the organization, those who might look at the collection for research, librarians who might be linking similar collections, and the general public who may know nothing about the organization at all. In keeping with these diverse communities, we had to make our finding aid both specific and generic to encompass all groups while following the format of archival finding aids. I think this finding aid accurately shows how all groups were included in the process of making a multi-use library or archive reference document.</p>
