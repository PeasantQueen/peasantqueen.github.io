<p>2c This is a library guide written for LIS 704 taught by Jeanne Holba Puacz. Since communities are diverse and their learning can be on many different levels, library guides are a good resource to provide content in a variety of formats. The goal to assess information needs means that the librarian has to provide a resource that can fit all people. While library guides can serve as a base, the librarian still needs to make a connection with the user before they can recommend any particular format. On this library guide, there are different formats of resources, mostly websites and books, that approach descriptions of movies in different ways such as genre, actors, subject, release date, or family-friendly content. Although it may not be inclusive of everything and might need to be updated frequently with newer publications as more movies are published, it does address a variety of search methods suited for multiple user types.</p>
