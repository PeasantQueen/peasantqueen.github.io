<p>4a This is an IMLS grant proposal written for LIS 759, Digital Libraries, taught by Carolyn Caizzi. There are two documents attached, one being the handout from the presentation on the grant proposal and the other being the submitted proposal text. In Digital Libraries, one of the assignments was to take a real collection that is not digitized and write up a grant proposal from beginning to end including materials, staff, budget, time, and housing of the collection. Through this process, I became familiar with all steps of archiving a digital collection, both in theory and practice. Although this collection was not selected for an IMLS grant, I learned a lot through the process of working with the Morton Arboretum staff about what resources they have available for digitizing, time frames, paid and volunteer staff knowledge and capabilities, as well as how to phrase these things on paper to show the needs of the organization. The research involved in an IMLS grant is extensive. First, you have to be familiar with the organizations resources. Then, you become familiar with the collection contents- will things degrade? is there a sense of urgency to get this information before it is gone? Next, you start in on the requirements of the grant. Has any organization received funding for similar projects? Is this digitization project worth pursuing as a grant recipient? Finally, you have to put together a budget, a paper, and a presentation on why this collection deserves to be funded. Every step of the process requires diligence, both to the organization and to the library science profession, to show how the desired collections needs help to get digitized. In either acceptance or denial, the grant process was useful to me in getting experience with a grant for digitization.</p>
