<p>This was my entrance essay to get into school. Isn't it crazy how two years go by so fast, and yet, so much happens that you're not even the person who wrote that anymore?</p>
<p>	Graduating in 2003, I thought the rest of my life would be paved in money, fame, and open doors with a promising career in Media. In 2016, having worked for a decade in event management, lived in seven different cities, and literally tied my life’s direction to someone else’s, I look at my previous self and the unrealistic visions as naive. Instead of following that career path, I became a knitting instructor, a street performing actress, a cake decorator, a customer service representative, and the host of a book club. I found that my greatest strengths are not necessarily in the tasks that I do, but in the impact of those tasks on others. I am at my best when I am telling a story passionately, inspiring someone to read a book or see a movie, and helping someone problem-solve by offering or showing them a new solution. I am able to perform my best when things are organized, scheduled, and decorated. I was on the search for a profession that thrives on creativity, organization, and inspiring others. Digitizing manuscripts, integrating new materials into old structures, heritage and genealogy searching, and 3D printing all sound like incredibly interesting tasks. I’m not sure where my emphasis will be in Library and Information Science, but I am very eager to find out. I hope you will not only consider me as a candidate for your school’s program, but look forward to having me. One day a thousand years from now, someone important will open a book that through my actions and those of 100 others with this degree was put into his or her hands. That person will say this is exactly what I needed to change my path/ to grow up/ to rule a nation/ to save a life. At that moment, the small impact of my education will finally pay off.
