  This is a video about the Association of Moving Image Archivists organization created for LIS 701 Intro to Library and Information Science taught by Karen Brown. The assignment for Intro to Library and Information Science was to take an organization and highlight how it meets the goals of librarianship. This video highlights not only goals, but how every person can get involved in preservation and connect with familiar things like home movies or popular Oscar winning films. Each of Michael Gorman's goals for librarianship is addressed in the video and how the AMIA meets that goal. This video shows an understanding of the goals and how they can be applied to different scenarios.</p>

  These are some photographs from the MAC (Midwest Archives Conference) that I attended in March 2018. There were a number of organizations and associations present that helped to make this event possible. Meeting with them about their organizations, their products, and their creeds helped me to see where different people all benefit from the same goals of librarianship, or in some cases, just one aspect of it like preservation. I sat in on four lectures and seminars over two days. I met people from NARA, the National Archives, who spoke about file storage and records management spaces. I met people from the Newberry Library and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Archives that spoke about their world's fair collections. I met people from National Public Radio and the Society of American Archivists who played a segment about a Chicago-based book that touched on racism in the local housing market. I also met with a number of different organizations who outlined their process of using grants to digitize collections or permanently rehouse existing collections by migrating to a new host and schema. Aside from following RSS feeds, all of these organizations provided a sign-up list for email. Organizations like the Northeast Document Conservation Center have very useful emails that give different techniques and updated processes for handling archival objects so I am very glad to have gone to MAC and added this resource to my growing list of references.</p>

  This is a video presentation for LIS 704 Reference and Online Services taught by Jeanne Holba Puacz. In this video interview for Reference and Online Services, I followed the process of a patron asking a librarian a question. Using footage from the interview, I highlighted the points when the librarian used different techniques and resources to fulfill the needs of the patron. I also discussed how the processes of the librarian followed Gorman's goals for librarianship in a local context. Demonstrating good practices for customer service and discussing these points on a public forum like YouTube allows interaction with a national or global audience. Seeing good practices and discussing different scenarios in a video while opening a dialogue for discussion in comments is a great way to reach a large audience to talk about ethics and values for an LIS program.</p>
