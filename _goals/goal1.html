<p>1a This is a video about the Association of Moving Image Archivists organization created for LIS 701 taught by Karen Snow. The assignment for Intro to Library and Information Science was to take an organization and highlight how it meets the goals of librarianship. This video highlights not only goals, but how every person can get involved in preservation and connect with familiar things like home movies or popular Oscar winning films.</p>

<p>1c These are some photographs from the MAC (Midwest Archives Conference) 2018 meeting in March 2018 that I attended. There were a number of organizations and associations present that helped to make this event possible. Meeting with them about their organizations, their products, and their creeds helped me to see where different people all benefit from the same goals of librarianship, or in some cases, just one aspect of it like preservation. I sat in on four lectures and seminars over two days. I met people from NARA, the National Archives, who spoke about file storage. I met people from the Newberry Library and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Archives that spoke about their world's fair collections. I met people from National Public Radio and the Society of American Archivists who played a segment about a Chicago-based book that showcased racism in the housing market. I also met with a number of different organizations who outlined their process of using grants to digitize collections or permanently rehouse existing collections by migrating to a new host and schema.</p>

<p>1d This is a video presentation for LIS 704 taught by Jeanne Holba Puacz. In this video interview for Reference and Online Services, I followed the process of a patron asking a librarian a question. Using footage from the interview, I highlighted the points when the librarian used different techniques and resources to fulfill the needs of the patron. I also discussed how the processes of the librarian followed Gorman's goals for librarianship in a local context.</p>
