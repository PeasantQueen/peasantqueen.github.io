<p>1a This is a video about the Association of Moving Image Archivists organization created for LIS 701 taught by Karen Snow. The assignment was to take an organization and highlight how it meets the goals of librarianship. This video highlights not only goals, but how every person can get involved in preservation and connect with familiar things like home movies or popular Oscar winning films.</p>

<p>1c I attended the MAC conference in March 2018. There were a number of organizations and associations present that helped to make this event possible. Meeting with them about their organizations, their products, and their creeds helped me to see where different people all benefit from the same goals of librarianship, or in some cases, just one aspect of it like preservation. Here are some photos from the different things I saw at this event. (Insert photos)</p>
