<p><em>5d Demonstrate effective professional communication to achieve common understanding.</em><br>
  This is a paper written for LIS 770 Management of Libraries and Information Centers taught by Bill Crowley. The assignment was to show how politics and culture are present in library science. This paper shows how professional communication is necessary to understand the needs of the community. In the case of the article, the person in power should have tried to communicate and understand that their personal value was different from the community before they took action. Although the subject did not use proper communication skills, the articles cited and the methods written in the paper show how the community (including other librarians and library board members) took action to make sure the community received fair representation ensuring common understanding was reached.</p>

<p><em>5e Demonstrate leadership in relation to professional practice (see also 5c).</em><br>
  This is a group project website created for LIS 786 Advanced Web Design taught by Brodie Austin. Although this project was collaborative, I created the message boards and followed up with the members on submission deadlines as well as put together a large portion of the technical work. There are several lessons to be learned in group projects- that everyone has different opinions on a common goal, that different needs of the users must be considered, that the common goal might mean sacrificing your personal vision, but also that one person needs to be the speaker or leader or planner who stands up for the decisions. During our project, I was tested several times on how to work with group dynamics, particularly people who did not understand the assignment or people who wanted to do the work differently, but also by myself who needed to learn when to make executive decisions vs. waiting for the majority to come to an agreement. In the end, the website turned out beautiful. It's a true collaboration of everyone's visions and reflects the needs of the users. The role of the leader is sometimes to make sure a clean, finished project makes its deadline and that could mean pushing people to do more work or taking extra time to ensure everyone on the team understands the process in order to do their own share. This website serves as a good example of my leadership because not only did everyone contribute and collaborate, but the finished product met the deadline.</p>
