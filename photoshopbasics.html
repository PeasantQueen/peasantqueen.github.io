<h2>Color correction- Adjust the layers to brighten or add contrast.</h2>
<p><img src="../images/screen1.png" alt="photoshop example image"></p>
<p>To determine the best color correction effect for this photo, select Image>Adjustments>Levels and Options. Click between different options to find the best choice using the live preview on the image. For this example, I chose Enhance Brightness & Contrast.
These tools can be accessed by clicking on Image (on the Menu Bar) and selecting Adjustments from the drop-down menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brightness/Contrast</li>
<li>Levels</li>
<li>Curves</li>
<li>Exposure</li>
<li>Shadows/Highlights</li>
<li>HDR Toning</li>
</ul>
<h2>Color Balancing</h2>
<p>Always remember to create a Photo Filter adjustment layer so that you can modify the color of your image while preserving the original one. First, open your chosen image in Photoshop. Click the Adjustment Layer icon in the Layers panel after, and select your desired Photo Filter. You can also apply a photo filter as a direct adjustment (Image > Adjustments > Photo Filter), since it provides a layer mask for editing only a part of your photo while protecting the original photo from permanent changes.</p>
<p>How to use Color Balance in Adobe Photoshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on Image in the Menu Bar, then click on Adjustments, then Color Balance.</li>
<li>Select which tones in the image you want to change (shadows, midtones, or highlights).</li>
<li>Check the Preview box to see your adjustments in real time.</li>
<li>Move the sliders to achieve your desired color balance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to use Selective Color in Adobe Photoshop:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Click on Image in the Menu Bar, then click on Adjustments, then Selective Color.</li>
<li>Check the Preview box to see your adjustments in real time.</li>
<li>Choose from Relative (a more subtle change) or Absolute.</li>
<li>Select the color from the drop-down menu that you want to adjust.</li>
<li>Move the sliders to increase or decrease the color cast from your chosen color.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cropping- Using the crop tool, you can change the focus of the photo to reposition the eye of the viewer by eliminating unnecessary background.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Select the crop tool   from the toolbox.</li>
<li>Select your desired aspect ratio by clicking on the drop-down menu (near the upper-right corner) and choosing from Unconstrained, Original Ratio, or any of the Preset options. You can also enter your own preferred dimensions in the text fields beside the menu.</li>
<li>Drag the corners or the edges of the photo to achieve your desired crop.</li>
<li>Press Enter or click the check icon   to finalize the crop.</li>

<h2>How to use Content-Aware Fill:</h2>
<p>The latest version of Photoshop now features the Content-Aware Fill option. This feature allows you to remove unwanted objects from your photos.
Here’s a quick summary on how you can use Content-Aware Fill:</p>
<ul>
<li>•	First, draw a selection around an area or object that you want to replace.</li>
<li>•	Make sure to create the selection as close to your subject as possible but leaving enough space to give Photoshop material to work with.</li>
<li>•	Open the Content-Aware Fill taskspace (Edit > Content-Aware Fill).</li>
<li>•	Resize the sampling area and your initial selection using the Sampling Brush Tool and the Lasso Tool respectively.</li>
<li>•	Tweak the Fill Settings to improve your output.</li>
<li>•	Finalize your output by creating a new layer.</li>
