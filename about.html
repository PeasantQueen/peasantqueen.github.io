<p>The name PeasantQueen comes from the idea that you do not have to be born rich to be great or have great ideas. Growing up in a lower class income family, Danielle struggled to work multiple jobs with her family to pay tuition, buy groceries, and keep the power on. Through these struggles, she and her family learned many lessons about kindness, generosity, and the merits of determination. The implication of PeasantQueen is that Danielle has risen above her born status to become a great leader. Danielle now devotes a portion of her time to charity and volunteering.</p>
<p>Founded in 1999, the PeasantQueen brand began on AOL Instant Messenger and continued through Danielle's college experience on her blog. Throughout the years, the brand has grown to include film productions, a Paypal link, an etsy store, and much more. As technology grows, PeasantQueen continues to advance into more media.
