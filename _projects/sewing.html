<h2>Sewing</h2>
<p>Quilting has become a love of Danielle's since 2004. She has taught quilting through classes at JoAnn Fabrics and regularly takes orders for quilts. She makes T-shirt quilts, samplers, and full pattern bedspreads. She meets monthly with a sewing group to complete various crafty projects. <figure><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/quilting.jpg" class="thumbnail_h"></figure></p>
<p>Clothing and costuming are another great love for Danielle. She started sewing or modifying her own clothes in high school and continued to take on greater tasks as she grew older including formalwear and original design cosplays. While she no longer works on daily wear clothes, she creates several costumes for re-enactment or cosplay every year.</p>
<p>Yarn. Danielle has a love/hate relationship with yarn. Although many close to her have received hand-knit scarves, hats, or gloves, the true dedication of a knitter is tested with every project. She has picked up yarn from several countries around the world from hand-dyed to commercial and works with several different weights to make socks, sweaters, or blankets. She does not design her own patterns. If you had to ask her favorite brand of yarn, she would recommend <a href="http://www.lionbrand.com/hometown-usa-yarn.html" title="lion brand hometown" target="_blank">Lion Brand Hometown USA</a>.</p>
