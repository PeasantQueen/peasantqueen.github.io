<h2>Paintings</h2>
<p>Repainted Dolls, or One-Of-A-Kind (OOAK) dolls are a hobby for Danielle. What started as a gift to make custom dolls for her friends and coworkers turned into a small side business to craft dolls for movies, television, or literary works that did not have sufficient products mass produced. These OOAK pieces range in price from $50-$100 each and can be custom ordered or found on the etsy shop. These dolls have also been used in various modern art installations like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJhELnTGr0s" title="art dolls" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p>
<p>Miniature Figures are a new type of art for Danielle. She started with minifig legos whose faces had worn away, moved onto childhood toys like Polly Pockets, and now works on board games like Star Wars Legion. Through the various degrees of painting minifigs, the projects tend to evade being photographed during the process.</p>
