<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>Danielle has multiple books and manuscripts out to publishers. She is a regular contributor to blogs and memes. She is also a ghost writer.</p>
<p>One of her biggest contributions to writing regularly is <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank" title="nanowrimo">NaNoWriMo</a>, an organization dedicated to writing one novel per year in the month of November. Although Danielle doesn't often finish her novel by the deadline, the processes and workshops help her to flesh out a new novel idea for every year. To follow along with Danielle or become writing buddies during the furious writing event every November, <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/participants/peasantqueen" title="nanowrimo buddies" target="_blank">follow along this link to become writing buddies</a>.</p>
